Barnsley Gymnastics Club Ltd does its best to deliver a safe, effective, good quality service with qualified coaches. We aim to provide a nurturing environment that helps develop children’s gymnastics ability and bring out their best. 

By becoming a member of the club, you agree to pay your fees in a timely fashion. Fees are due monthly (instalments can be agreed on a discretionary basis) in advance and are payable whether or not your child attends. 

The fees are paid for the place, not the attendance. The club is closed for one week at Christmas and allow for 1 week's holiday, so charge for 50 weeks a year, and divide that across the year, so your monthly fee stays the same, despite the number of training sessions in a month. 
Our standard hourly rate is £6 per hour, so for 1 hour a week your monthly fee is calculated as £6 * 1 hour per week x 50 weeks / 12 months = £25 per month.

We operate a sliding scale of discounts so that children who wish to attend more than one class or try other disciplines can benefit.

In cases of long-term illness or injury please get in touch with the club manager to discuss the possibility of a discretionary waiver. This will not apply for normal childhood illnesses etc., during which absences fees will still be due.

Barnsley Gymnastics Club Ltd requires seven days’ notice if you are going to leave the club. Monthly fees already paid are not refundable.

Siblings are offered a 20% discount on the main monthly fee calculator however membership fees for the club and British gymnastics are not reduced.

Membership of British Gymnastics is compulsory as this membership ensures your child is insured. It is due immediately after the second session if your child decides to continue training and is valid until the next October. More information on how to join and the other benefits of BG membership are [available here](https://www.british-gymnastics.org/renewal-options).

A small fee for membership of the club is also payable. This is valid for 12 months from the time of payment.

Additional fees may be incurred if children are selected to enter competitions, such as entry fees and special clothing.  Entering competitions is optional.
